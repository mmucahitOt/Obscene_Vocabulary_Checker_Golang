<h2>The groceries map</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>Emma needs to go to the supermarket, and she has created a map <code class="language-go">groceries</code> that contains the items she needs to buy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">groceries := map[string]int{
    "toothpaste":      1,
    "shampoo":         1,
    "soap":            2,
    "chicken breasts": 3,
    "potatoes":        2,
}</code></pre>
<p>When she arrived at the supermarket, she remembered that some guests were coming for dinner today, so she decided to buy <code class="language-go">8</code> potatoes instead of <code class="language-go">2</code>.</p>
<p>Which code line would allow her to update the <em>value</em> of <code class="language-go">potatoes</code> from <code class="language-go">2</code> to <code class="language-go">8</code> in the <code class="language-go">groceries</code> map?</p>
</div>
